redis config application should be running.

redis should be installed locally i.e. sudo apt-get install redis
check command -> redis-cli
checking command for server up -> ping then it will show pong. 

to set password -> set config ""

redis dependencies should be added in pom(in that service in which redis is used).
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.tech</groupId>
	<artifactId>redis</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

the service which is using the redis can publish the message event.

the service which wants to use that redis contained service can subscribe to that service in order to use it..
